### I need help (Contibuting)

I am very happy the basic api of skia can work, and a simple demo can run on osx. Now I want to support more api and let it work on more platform. Because I can only do this repo in my spare time, so the progress is really not fast.

I'm very glad to see any kind of pr, issues are welcome.
